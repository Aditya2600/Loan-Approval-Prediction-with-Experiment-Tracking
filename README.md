# ðŸ§ª Experiment Tracking with MLflow

This document demonstrates how to effectively track machine learning experiments using **MLflow**, covering the end-to-end workflow of preprocessing, training models, hyperparameter tuning, and result visualization.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview of Experiment Tracking

Building machine learning models involves iterative experimentation and tuning:
- **ML includes code and data**, both of which must be tracked.
- Experimentation involves testing:
  - Different data configurations.
  - Models and hyperparameters.
  - Various environments.
- **Experiment Tracking** solves these challenges by:
  - Logging data, hyperparameters, models, and results.
  - Allowing comparison of experiment runs.

### Key Benefits of Experiment Tracking
1. **Organize:** Keep all components of an experiment in one place.
2. **Reproduce:** Easily reproduce past results using logged configurations.
3. **Log Improvements:** Monitor changes over time, including new data, ideas, or team collaborations.
